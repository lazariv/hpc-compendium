In order to use the ZIH systems installed at ZIH, a project application form has to be filled in.
The HPC project manager should hold a professorship (university) or head a research group. You may
also apply for a "Schnupperaccount" (trial account) for one year to find out if the machine is
useful for your application.

An other able use case is to request resources for a courses.
