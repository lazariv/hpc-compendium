# Access to ZIH Systems

There are several different ways to access ZIH systems depending on the intended usage:

* [SSH connection](ssh_login.md) is the classical way to connect to the login nodes and work from
    the command line to set up experiments and manage batch jobs
* [Desktop Cloud Visualization](desktop_cloud_visualization.md) provides a virtual Linux desktop
  with access to GPU ressources for OpenGL 3D applications
* [WebVNC service](graphical_applications_with_webvnc.md) allows better support for graphical
   applications than SSH with X forwarding
* [JupyterHub service](jupyterhub.md) offers a quick and easy way to work with Jupyter notebooks on
   ZIH systems.

!!! hint

    Prerequisite for accessing ZIH systems is a HPC project and a login. Please refer to the pages
    within [Application for Login and Resources](../application/overview.md) for detailed
    information.
